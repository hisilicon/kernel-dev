config NET_VENDOR_HISILICON
	bool "Hisilicon devices"
	default y
	depends on ARM || ARM64
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Hisilicon devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_HISILICON

config HIX5HD2_GMAC
	tristate "Hisilicon HIX5HD2 Family Network Device Support"
	select PHYLIB
	help
	  This selects the hix5hd2 mac family network device.

config HIP04_ETH
	tristate "HISILICON P04 Ethernet support"
	select PHYLIB
	select MARVELL_PHY
	select MFD_SYSCON
	---help---
	  If you wish to compile a kernel for a hardware with hisilicon p04 SoC and
	  want to use the internal ethernet then you should answer Y to this.

config HIP05_GMAC
	tristate "Hisilicon HIP05 Ethernet Support"
	select PHYLIB
	help
	  This selects the hip05 network device.

config HNS
	tristate "Hisilicon Network Subsystem Support (Framework)"
	---help---
	  This selects the framework support for Hisilicon network subsystem. It
	  is needed by any driver which provide hns acceleration engine or make
	  use of the engine

config HNS_DSAF
	tristate "Hisilicon HNS DSAF device Support"
	select HNS
	select HNS_MDIO
	---help---
	  This selects the DSAF network acceleration engine support. The engine
	  is used in Hisilicon P660, Hi1610 and more further ICT SoC

config HNS_MDIO
	tristate "Hisilicon HNS MDIO device Support"
	select MDIO
	---help---
	  This selects the HNS MDIO support. It is needed by HNS_DSAF to access
	  the PHY

config HNS_ENET
	tristate "Hisilicon HNS Ethernet Device Support"
	select PHYLIB
	select HNS
	---help---
	  This selects the general ethernet driver for HNS.  This module make
	  use of any HNS AE driver, such as HNS_DSAF
